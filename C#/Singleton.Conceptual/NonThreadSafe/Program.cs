// Singleton Design Pattern
//
// Intent: Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a
// global access point to this instance.

using System;

namespace Singleton
{
    // The Singleton class defines the `GetInstance` method that serves as an
    // alternative to constructor and lets clients access the same instance of
    // this class over and over.
    class Singleton

        // The Singleton's constructor should always be private to prevent
        // direct construction calls with the `new` operator.
        private Singleton() { }

        // The Singleton's instance is stored in a static field. There there are
        // multiple ways to initialize this field, all of them have various pros
        // and cons. In this example we'll show the simplest of these ways,
        // which, however, doesn't work really well in multithreaded program.
        private static Singleton _instance;

        // This is the static method that controls the access to the singleton
        // instance. On the first run, it creates a singleton object and places
        // it into the static field. On subsequent runs, it returns the client
        // existing object stored in the static field.

                _instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return _instance;
        }

        // Finally, any singleton should define some business logic, which can
        // be executed on its instance.
