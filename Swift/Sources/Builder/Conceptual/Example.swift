/// Builder Design Pattern
///
/// Intent: Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows
/// you to produce different types and representations of an object using the

/// The Builder interface specifies methods for creating the different parts of
/// the Product objects.
protocol Builder {

    func producePartA()
    func producePartB()

/// The Concrete Builder classes follow the Builder interface and provide
/// specific implementations of the building steps. Your program may have
/// several variations of Builders, implemented differently.

    /// used in further assembly.

    /// Concrete Builders are supposed to provide their own methods for

    /// entirely different products that don't follow the same interface.
    /// Therefore, such methods cannot be declared in the base Builder interface
    /// (at least in a statically typed programming language).
    ///
    /// Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder
    /// instance is expected to be ready to start producing another product.
    /// That's why it's a usual practice to call the reset method at the end of
    /// the `getProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not mandatory,
    /// and you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset call from the
    /// client code before disposing of the previous result.

/// specific order or configuration. Strictly speaking, the Director class is
/// optional, since the client can control builders directly.
